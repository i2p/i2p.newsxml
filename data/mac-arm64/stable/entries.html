<p>
Unfortunately we were unable to release a 2.0.0 OSX Easy-Install Bundle in December as promised.
As the 2.1.0 release was accelerated by six weeks, we will not be releasing 2.0.0.
We are now focused on the build and release for the 2.1.0 Bundle.
</p><p>
We will make an annoucement here in the news feed when it is ready.

Thanks for your patience.

<p>
The 2.0.0 update for the I2P OSX Easy-Install Bundle will be delayed,
because our OSX maintainer zlatinb recently resigned his position.
We are working to replace the expertise, hardware, and credentials required to build and release updates.
</p><p>
Our current estimate is that the update will be available in about a month.
We will make an annoucement here in the news feed when it is ready.
