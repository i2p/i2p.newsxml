<p>
This latest release of the I2P Easy-Install Bundle for Windows revises the packaging of the bundle to be self-contained and portable.
The profile manager is moved to an I2P plugin and un-bundled from the router launcher itself, enabling it to be updated without a router update or even a router restart.
Many of these changes were previewed in the recent pre-releases.
During testing we chose to disable Chromium-wrapping capabilities, meaning the bundle still depends on an existing Firefox installation.
The profile manager has also been integrated with the desktop UI.

<summary>I2P Easy-Install Bundle for Windows 2.4.9</summary>
</details>
<p>
    <p>This is a pre-release of the I2P Easy-Install Bundle for Windows.
        This changes how the I2P bundle and browser profile manager are installed and integrated with the host system.
        The Easy-Install bundle is now a "portable" system that can be moved to different locations within or between Windows file-systems while retaining all built-in functionality.
        A shortcut for starting the I2P router is still provided by the installer for convenience, but the shortcuts for starting the I2P Browser are now integrated with the I2P desktop UI.</p>
        
        <p>The browser profile manager itself has been split away from the monolithic I2P router+Java/jpackage, and moved into an I2P plugin managed by the router.
        While this was done primarily to reduce how complex the existing code was, this also results in behavior which is closer to the main distribution of I2P for Windows and will lead to a more flexible installer, which can bundle additional default plugins and may be suitable for installation as a Windows service.
        I2P Plugins can also be updated independently of the router that hosts them, so it will be possible to update the browser profile manager independently of the router itself.
        It also means that the browser profile manager can be un-installed by uninstalling the plugin, and much more importantly that the browser profile manager is now compatible with all Java I2P distributions.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why a dev build 3 weeks before the release?</strong></p>
        
        <p>By further delineating the components of the bundle, these changes also affected how the release process happens.
        In particular the build process of each component has been encapsulated in a CI description which can be reproduced on a local PC.
        This simplifies and automates the build process by ensuring that up-to-date build tools are installed in a brand-new container for every build.
        In effect this should speed up the release process for I2P Easy-Install for Windows considerably.
        This release is a test-run of the new process, so I can document what is going on.
        It breaks down roughly like this:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>It takes ~22 minutes to compile all the targets for the <code>i2p.plugins.firefox</code> and make the resulting artifacts available. During this process, I must insert 1 HSM and enter 1 password. (This part used to be about 30 steps, now it takes 1)</li>
        <li>It takes ~22 minutes to compile all the targets for the <code>i2p.firefox</code> project and make the resulting artifacts available. This process produces only unsigned artifacts identified by their hashes, and is non-interactive. (This part used to be around 60 steps the first time, and 40 steps each additional time)</li>
        <li><code>i2p.firefox</code> updates are signed in their <code>.su3</code> form. The <code>NSIS</code>-powered <code>.exe</code> installer is the current updater. The next step is to sign <em>just this installer</em> and generate a torrent of the result. (This process used to depend on the previous build process and couldn't be done independently. Now it takes about 30 seconds)</li>
        <li>Generate and sign a newsfeed to notify the users of an update. This process is the only process that is <strong>slower</strong> when containerized, because there are dozens of feeds to be signed in their respective containers. It takes about an hour.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>For you the end user, nothing much should change.
        You'll get your updates a lot faster, and have more options available for testing.
        The same installer is used for the updater, and the process is handled the same way.
        However for developers, testers, and maintainers, this release will result in big changes for the better.</p>
        
        <p>This release still embeds a <code>2.4.0</code> Java I2P router. No changes have been made to update the embedded router.
        Network behavior will be unchanged until the official <code>2.5.0</code> release.</p>

<summary>I2P Easy-Install for Windows 2.3.0 Release</summary>
</details>
<p>
    The I2P Easy-Install bundle for Windows version 2.3.0 has now been released.
    As usual, this release includes an updated version of the I2P router.
    This extends to security issues which affect people hosting services on the network.
</p>
<p>
    This will be the last release of the Easy-Install bundle which will be incompatible with the I2P Desktop GUI.
    It has been updated to include new versions of all included webextensions.
    A longstanding bug in I2P in Private Browsing which makes it incompatible with custom themes has been fixed.
    Users are still advised to *not* install custom themes.
    Snark tabs are not automatically pinned to the top of the tab order in Firefox.
    Except for using alternate cookieStores, Snark tabs now behave as normal browser tabs.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Unfortunately, this release is still an unsigned <code>.exe</code> installer.</b>
    Please verify the checksum of the installer before using it.
    <b>The updates, on the other hand</b> are signed by my I2P signing keys and therefore safe.
</p>
<p>
    This release was compiled with OpenJDK 20.
    It uses i2p.plugins.firefox version 1.1.0 as a library for launching the browser.
    It uses i2p.i2p version 2.3.0 as an I2P router, and to provide applications.
    As always it is recommended that you update to the latest version of the I2P router at your earliest convenient opportunity.

<p>
This point release includes a bug fix in the included I2P router, which resolves
a highly obscure bug where the context clock is out of sync with the clock in
use by the File System, resulting in a router which is unable to read the current
state of it's own NetDB. Although this bug has only been observed on Windows 11
so far, it is highly recommended that all users update to the new build.
</p>
<p>
This release also features faster startup times improved stability in the profile

<summary>This update includes the new 1.9.0 router and major quality-of-life improvements for bundle users</summary>
</details>
        <p>
            This release includes the new I2P 1.8.0 router and is based on Java 18.02.1.
        </p>
        <p>
            The old batch scripts have been phased out in favor of a more flexible and stable solution in the jpackage itself. This should fix all bugs related to path-finding and path-quoting which were present in the batch scripts. After you upgrade, the batch scripts can be safely deleted. They will be removed by the installer in the next update.
        </p>
        <p>
            A sub-project for managing browsing tools has been started: <a href="http://git.idk.i2p/idk/i2p.plugins.firefox">i2p.plugins.firefox</a> which has extensive capabilities for configuring I2P browsers automatically and stably on many platforms. This was used to replace the batch scripts but also functions as a cross-platform I2P Browser management tool. Contributions are welcome.
        </p>
        <p>
            This release improves compatibility with externally-running I2P routers such as those provided by the IzPack installer and by third-party router implementations such as i2pd. By improving external router discovery it requires less of a system's resources, improves start-up time, and prevents resource conflicts from occurring.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides that, the profile has been updated to the latest version of the Arkenfox profile. I2P in Private Browsing and NoScript have both been updated. The profile has been restructured in order to allow for evaluating different configurations for different threat models.

            New installations will be done without admin rights, making the updates fully silent for new installs. Admin installs will still require an elevation prompt to update. If you have installed I2P with the IzPack installer, a jpackage will not be installed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The launcher scripts have been fixed to avoid launching multiple instances of I2P when run repeatedly before I2P has a chance to start. The profile selector was fixed to work with IzPack installs in admin-less mode.

            I2P in Private Browsing was updated with experimental machine translations for multiple new languages. Community members are invited to contribute to them directly via Gitlab or Github for now.
