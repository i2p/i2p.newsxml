            <summary>This update includes the new 1.8.0, new languages, and profile/launcher improvements</summary>
        </details>
        <p>
            This release includes the new I2P 1.8.0 router and is based on Java 17.03.
        </p>
        <p>
            New installations will be done without admin rights, making the updates fully silent for new installs. Admin installs will still require an elevation prompt to update. If you have installed I2P with the IzPack installer, a jpackage will not be installed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The launcher scripts have been fixed to avoid launching multiple instances of I2P when run repeatedly before I2P has a chance to start. The profile selector was fixed to work with IzPack installs in admin-less mode.
        </p>
        <p>
            I2P in Private Browsing was updated with experimental machine translations for multiple new languages. Community members are invited to contribute to them directly via Gitlab or Github for now.
