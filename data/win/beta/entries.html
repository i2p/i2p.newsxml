<summary>I2P Easy-Install for Windows 2.3.0 Release</summary>
</details>
<p>
    The I2P Easy-Install bundle for Windows version 2.3.0 has now been released.
    As usual, this release includes an updated version of the I2P router.
    This extends to security issues which affect people hosting services on the network.
</p>
<p>
    This will be the last release of the Easy-Install bundle which will be incompatible with the I2P Desktop GUI.
    It has been updated to include new versions of all included webextensions.
    A longstanding bug in I2P in Private Browsing which makes it incompatible with custom themes has been fixed.
    Users are still advised to *not* install custom themes.
    Snark tabs are not automatically pinned to the top of the tab order in Firefox.
    Except for using alternate cookieStores, Snark tabs now behave as normal browser tabs.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Unfortunately, this release is still an unsigned <code>.exe</code> installer.</b>
    Please verify the checksum of the installer before using it.
    <b>The updates, on the other hand</b> are signed by my I2P signing keys and therefore safe.
</p>
<p>
    This release was compiled with OpenJDK 20.
    It uses i2p.plugins.firefox version 1.1.0 as a library for launching the browser.
    It uses i2p.i2p version 2.3.0 as an I2P router, and to provide applications.
    As always it is recommended that you update to the latest version of the I2P router at your earliest convenient opportunity.

<summary>I2P Easy-Install Bundle 1.9.5 Point Release</summary>
</details>
<p>
This point release includes a bug fix in the included I2P router, which resolves
a highly obscure bug where the context clock is out of sync with the clock in
use by the File System, resulting in a router which is unable to read the current
state of it's own NetDB. Although this bug has only been observed on Windows 11
so far, it is highly recommended that all users update to the new build.
</p>
<p>
This release also features faster startup times improved stability in the profile
manager.

<summary>This update includes the new 1.9.0 router and major quality-of-life improvements for bundle users</summary>
</details>
        <p>
            This release includes the new I2P 1.8.0 router and is based on Java 18.02.1.
        </p>
        <p>
            The old batch scripts have been phased out in favor of a more flexible and stable solution in the jpackage itself. This should fix all bugs related to path-finding and path-quoting which were present in the batch scripts. After you upgrade, the batch scripts can be safely deleted. They will be removed by the installer in the next update.
        </p>
        <p>
            A sub-project for managing browsing tools has been started: <a href="http://git.idk.i2p/idk/i2p.plugins.firefox">i2p.plugins.firefox</a> which has extensive capabilities for configuring I2P browsers automatically and stably on many platforms. This was used to replace the batch scripts but also functions as a cross-platform I2P Browser management tool. Contributions are welcome.
        </p>
        <p>
            This release improves compatibility with externally-running I2P routers such as those provided by the IzPack installer and by third-party router implementations such as i2pd. By improving external router discovery it requires less of a system's resources, improves start-up time, and prevents resource conflicts from occurring.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides that, the profile has been updated to the latest version of the Arkenfox profile. I2P in Private Browsing and NoScript have both been updated. The profile has been restructured in order to allow for evaluating different configurations for different threat models.

        <p>
            New installations will be done without admin rights, making the updates fully silent for new installs. Admin installs will still require an elevation prompt to update. If you have installed I2P with the IzPack installer, a jpackage will not be installed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The launcher scripts have been fixed to avoid launching multiple instances of I2P when run repeatedly before I2P has a chance to start. The profile selector was fixed to work with IzPack installs in admin-less mode.
        </p>
        <p>
            I2P in Private Browsing was updated with experimental machine translations for multiple new languages. Community members are invited to contribute to them directly via Gitlab or Github for now.
