As routers have updated to that release, the network has gone from about 1% to over 60% support for our new SSU2 transport protocol.
First, we have confirmed that SSU2 is a solid, well designed, and secure protocol.
Second, however, we have found and fixed numerous minor or rarely-triggered bugs in the implementation of the protocol.
Cumulatively, the effects of these bugs have reduced the performance of the network.</p>
<p>Also, we are aware of increased tunnel count and reduced tunnel build success rate in the network,
possibly triggered by Bitcoin's new I2P transient address feature,
but made worse by our SSU2 bugs and other congestion control problems.
We are working with Bitcoin and other non-Bitcoin projects to reduce I2P network demands.
We have improved our algorithms to reduce network load during times of congestion.
We are also collaborating with i2pd to develop common congestion control strategies.</p>
<p>Therefore, we have accelerated this release by about six weeks, to get the fixes out to everybody.
i2pd released their version 2.45.0 last week and the early results are encouraging.
New protocols, and distributed networks, are difficult to develop.
Congestion can arrive with little warning and with little clue of the cause.
Thank you for your patience as we have diagnosed and hopefully fixed the problems.</p>

with a small number of volunteer testers.
This release completes the implementation, including relay and peer testing.
We are enabling it by default for Android and ARM platforms, and a small percentage of other routers at random.
This will allow us to do much more testing in the next three months, finish the connection migration feature,
and fix any remaining issues.
We plan to enable it for everyone in the next release scheduled for November.
No manual configuration is necessary.</p>
<p>Of course, there's the usual collection of bug fixes in this release as well.
We also added an automatic deadlock detector that has already found a rare deadlock that is now fixed.</p>

the router, I2CP, and UPnP.
Router fixes address bugs in soft restart, IPv6, SSU peer testing,
network database stores, and tunnel building.
Router family handling and Sybil classification have also been
significantly improved.</p>
<p>Together with i2pd, we are developing our new UDP transport, SSU2.
SSU2 will bring substantial performance and security improvements.
It will also allow us to finally replace our last usage of the very slow ElGamal encryption,
completing the full cryptography upgrade we started about 9 years ago.
This release contains a preliminary implementation which is disabled by default.

We have several improvements and fixes for the SSU (UDP) transport that should result in faster speeds.
This release also starts the migration to new, faster ECIES-X25519 encryption for routers.
(Destinations have been using this encryption for a few releases now)
We've been working on the specifications and protocols for new encryption for several years,
and we are getting close to the end of it! The migration will take several releases to complete.</p>
<p>For this release, to minimize disruption, only new installs and a very small percentage of existing installs
(randomly selected at restart) will be using the new encryption.
If your router does "rekey" to use the new encryption, it may have lower traffic or less reliability than usual for several days after you restart.
This is normal, because your router has generated a new identity.
Your performance should recover after a while.</p>
<p>We have "rekeyed" the network twice before, when changing the default signature type,
but this is the first time we've changed the default encryption type.
Hopefully it will all go smoothly, but we're starting slowly to be sure.</p>

The previous versions are no longer supported, and are not available in the upcoming Debian Stretch and Ubuntu Zesty releases.
The router will migrate the jetty.xml configuration file for each Jetty website to the new Jetty 9 setup.
This should work for recent, unmodified configurations but may not work for modified or very old setups.
Verify that your Jetty website works after upgrading, and contact us on IRC if you need assistance.</p>
<p>Several plugins are not compatible with Jetty 9 and must be updated.
The following plugins have been updated to work with 0.9.30, and your router should update them after restart:
i2pbote 0.4.6; zzzot 0.15.0.
The following plugins (with current versions listed) will not work with 0.9.30.
Contact the appropriate plugin developer for the status of new versions:
BwSchedule 0.0.36; i2pcontrol 0.11.</p>
<p>This release also supports migration of old (2014 and earlier) DSA-SHA1 hidden services to the more-secure EdDSA signature type.
See <a href="http://zzz.i2p/topics/2271">zzz.i2p</a> for further information, including a guide and FAQ.</p>
<p>Note: On non-Android ARM platforms such as the Raspberry Pi, the blockfile database will upgrade on restart, which may take several minutes.

I2P-Bote plugin. The Android app was not affected.</p>
<p>A lack of CSRF protection meant that if a user was running I2P-Bote and then loaded a
malicious site in a browser with JavaScript enabled, the adversary could trigger actions
in I2P-Bote on behalf of the user, such as sending messages. This might also have enabled
extraction of private keys for I2P-Bote addresses, however no proof-of-exploit was tested
for this.</p>
<p>All I2P-Bote users will be upgraded automatically the first time they restart their router
after I2P 0.9.28 is released in mid-December. However, for safety we recommend that you
<a href="http://bote.i2p/install/">follow the instructions on the installation page</a> to
upgrade manually if you plan on using I2P or I2P-Bote in the intervening time. You should
also consider generating new I2P-Bote addresses if you regularly browse sites with
JavaScript enabled while running I2P-Bote.</p>

The updated GMP library for crypto acceleration, which was bundled in the 0.9.26 release for new installs and Debian builds only, is now included in the in-network update for 0.9.27.
There are improvements in IPv6 transports, SSU peer testing, and hidden mode.</p>
<p>We updated a number of plugins during <a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/en/blog/post/2016/06/01/I2P-Summer-Dev">I2P Summer</a> and your router will automatically update them after restart.</p>

a new addressbook subscription protocol with signatures,
and major improvements to the Debian/Ubuntu packaging.</p>
<p>For crypto, we have upgraded to GMP 6.0.0, and added support for newer processors,
which will speed up crypto operations considerably.
Also, we are now using constant-time GMP functions to prevent side-channel attacks.
For caution, the GMP changes are enabled for new installs and Debian/Ubuntu builds only;
we will include them for in-net updates in the 0.9.27 release.</p>
<p>For Debian/Ubuntu builds, we have added dependencies on several packages,
including Jetty 8 and geoip, and removed the equivalent bundled code.</p>
<p>There's a collection of bug fixes also, including a fix for a timer bug
that caused instability and performance degradations over time.

It adds QR codes for sharing hidden service addresses with others,
and "identicon" images for visually distinguishing addresses.</p>
<p>We've added a new "router family" configuration page in the console,
to make it easier to declare that your group of routers is run by a single person.
There are several changes to increase the capacity of the network and hopefully improve tunnel build success.</p>

Note that this release is the first to require Java 7.
Please update to Java 7 or 8 as soon as possible.
Your router will not automatically update if you are using Java 6.</p>
<p>To prevent the problems caused by the ancient commons-logging library, we have removed it.
This will cause very old I2P-Bote plugins (0.2.10 and below, signed by HungryHobo) to crash if they have IMAP enabled.
The recommended fix is to replace your old I2P-Bote plugin with the current one signed by str4d.

This is the first release signed by me (str4d), after 49 releases
signed by zzz. This is an important test of our redundancy for all things,
including people.</p>
<p><b>Housekeeping</b></p>
<p>My signing key has been in router updates for over two years (since 0.9.9), so
if you are on a recent version of I2P this update should be just as easy as
every other update. However, if you are running an older version than 0.9.9, you
will first need to manually update to a recent version. Update files for recent
versions can be downloaded
<a href="http://whnxvjwjhzsske5yevyokhskllvtisv5ueokw6yvh6t7zqrpra2q.b32.i2p/releases/">here</a>,
and instructions on how to manually update are provided
<a href="http://i2p-projekt.i2p/en/download#update">here</a>. Once you have manually
updated, your router will then find and download the 0.9.23 update as usual.</p>
<p>If you installed I2P via a package manager, you are not affected by the change,
and can update as usual.</p>
<p><b>Update details</b></p>
<p>The migration of RouterInfos to new, stronger Ed25519 signatures is going well,
with at least half of the network already estimated to have rekeyed. This
release accelerates the rekeying process. To reduce network churn, your router
will have a small probability of converting to Ed25519 at each restart. When it
does rekey, expect to see lower bandwidth usage for a couple of days as it
reintegrates into the network with its new identity.</p>
<p>Note that this will be the last release to support Java 6. Please update to
Java 7 or 8 as soon as possible. We are already working to make I2P compatible
with the upcoming Java 9, and some of that work is in this release.</p>
<p>We have also made some minor improvements in I2PSnark, and added a new page in
the routerconsole for viewing older news items.</p>

To reduce network churn, your router will have only a small probability of converting to Ed25519 at each restart.
When it does rekey, expect to see lower bandwidth usage for a couple of days as it reintegrates into the network with its new identity.
If all goes well, we will accelerate the rekeying process in the next release.</p>
